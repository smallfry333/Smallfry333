            <h3>Project 1</h3>
            <p>One of my projects was typing about my favorite book that included its image and the correct use of HTML elements and headings levels.</p>
            <p> This website is located <a href="file:///C:/Users/jonathan.yarde/Downloads/Yarde_Jonathan_Favorite-Book.html">here.</a></p>

            <h3>Project 2</h3>
            <p> Another project I had was to create a lab that involved more CSS. I was able to create lists and links while positioning diffeent words in different spaces. </p>
            <p> This website is located <a href="file:///C:/Users/jonathan.yarde/AppData/Local/Temp/fcfc0e37-1c09-41e2-bf3c-302b8e781ddb_CSSLab%20(1).zip.ddb/CSSLab/index.html">here.</a></p>

            <h3>Project 3</h3>
            <p> Lastly my latest project has been my most successful one yet. I was able to do multiple things on that website like flipping a card and filter items on a list</p>
